# Programming Study

This is intended to be a comprehensive study of subjects and concepts related to programming as a profession. I'm starting this as a kind of guide to be aggressively prepared for coding interviews, which can be pretty performative and difficult at times.

All runnable code examples will live in the file structure and elaborated concepts will be in the wiki.
